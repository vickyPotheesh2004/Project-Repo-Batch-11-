# 🎧 AudioMind: Automated Podcast Transcription & Insights

AudioMind is a powerful AI-driven platform that transforms raw audio content into structured, actionable insights. By leveraging advanced NLP models and real-time 3D visualization, it automates transcription, topic segmentation, title generation, and cross-language translation.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Transcription**
-   Uses **OpenAI's Whisper Small** model (244M params) for high-accuracy speech-to-text.
-   **Native Language Transcription**: Automatically transcribes in the original language (Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, etc.) rather than translating to English.
-   **Manual Language Selection**: Override auto-detection when needed for songs with heavy background music.
-   Handles various accents, music, and audio conditions effectively.

### 2. **Topic Segmentation with Context-Aware Titles**
-   Automatically divides audio into coherent topic segments.
-   **Generates semantic topic titles** (max 8-10 words) for each segment.
-   Uses semantic analysis to detect topic shifts and speaker changes.
-   Topics are displayed in **chronological order** by start time.
-   Labels ambiguous boundaries as **UNKNOWN** for enterprise safety.

### 3. **Interactive Timeline Visualization**
-   **Horizontal Bar Graph**: Visualizes podcast segments as a proportional bar graph using **Matplotlib**.
-   **Color-Coded Segments**: Each topic has a distinct color for easy identification.
-   **Click-to-Navigate**: Select any topic button to view its full details.
-   **Time Markers**: Shows start/end times on the timeline axis.

### 4. **3D Animation Layer**
-   **Real-Time Visualization**: Represents podcast structure and topic flow in 3D.
-   **Animated Topic Nodes**: Each segment is a distinct 3D node/scene.
-   **Timestamp Synchronization**: Animations sync with transcript timestamps.
-   **Responsive Behavior**: Adapts dynamically as new segments are detected.
-   Powered by **Three.js** for WebGL rendering.

### 5. **Sentiment Analysis**
-   **Scaled Scoring**: Sentiment displayed on a user-friendly **1-10 scale**.
-   **Color-Coded Labels**: Positive (green), Neutral (orange), Negative (red).
-   Uses **TextBlob** for sentiment polarity detection.

### 6. **Abstractive Summarization**
-   Generates concise, human-readable summaries for each topic.
-   Follows a consistent *"This topic is about..."* format using **Flan-T5** and custom prompting.

### 7. **Multi-Language Translation**
-   **Supports 10+ Languages**: Including Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu, Arabic, Russian, and more.
-   **Smart Chunking**: Handles long transcripts (>10,000 characters) without truncation.
-   Powered by **`deep-translator`** (Google Translate backend).

### 8. **Localization (Romanization)**
-   **Readable Script**: Converts non-English translations into readable English characters.
-   **Standardized Format**: Uses **IAST** via **`indic-transliteration`** for phonetically accurate readability.
-   **Dual Display**: Shows both original script and romanized text side-by-side.

### 9. **Large File Support**
-   Optimized for large podcast episodes.
-   Supports file uploads up to **4GB**.
-   Scalable to long-form audio (>2 hours).

### 10. **Keyword Word Clouds**
-   **Visual Keyword Representation**: Each topic displays a word cloud of its keywords.
-   **Importance-Based Sizing**: Keywords are sized based on TF-IDF importance.
-   Powered by **`wordcloud`** library.
