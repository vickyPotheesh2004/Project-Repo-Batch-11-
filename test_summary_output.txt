Topic 0 (Podcasts):
The podcasts are meant to supplement, not to substitute, class time and teaching. The purpose of these podcasts is to help students using al-kitab with their homework. These podcasts also provide some additional language input.

Topic 1 (Literature):
That words literature, they are a little more abstract, do not have any article at all in English. I study literature, not the literature, unless we are talking about something specific. We do not say the literature, a lot of times we just say literature.

Topic 2 (Sun Letters):
When you have a sun letter, you do not pronounce the lamb if there is an al-iflam. If there is no al-iflam on the DVD, it is going to sound something Talib Misri. You just put a shada on the next letter on the sun letter.

Topic 3 (Nisbah):
One of the things you do if you are going to say somebody from a country, you take the word for the country emreka, you take off that final alef. And on the next page they give you some examples about how to form the nisbah adjective. The example they give you, maha mesriya.
