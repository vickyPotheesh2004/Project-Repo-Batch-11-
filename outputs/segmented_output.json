Plus you could pay no monthly banking fees, but really you get much much more. Banking with HSBC has many advantages like $0 global wire transfer fees, no interact e-transfer fees and access to over 3,380 amps all over the country. And also I've noticed that HSBC offers 10 gender neutral titles, not just Mr and Mrs and Mrs. Which is often all you'll give them in title options. Visit HSBC.ca slash offers today to get started.",
